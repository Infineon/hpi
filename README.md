# HPI middleware library 1.0

## Overview

The **Host Processor Interface (HPI)** library implements the HPI transport, protocol, register and power delivery (PD) message handling. It allows the host processor or embedded controller (EC) to monitor the status of the USB PD ports, change configuration, perform firmware updates and transparently interact with other connected PMG1 and CCGx USB PD devices.

The HPI middleware is released in the form of pre-compiled library.

## Features

1) Firmware version identification
2) Firmware update capability
3) Reporting of Type-C and USB PD connection status
4) Interrupt-based event reporting when connection status changes
5) Control USB PD power profiles

## Quick start
